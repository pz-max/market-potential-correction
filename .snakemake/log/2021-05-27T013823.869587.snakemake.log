Building DAG of jobs...
WorkflowError:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
If building the DAG exceeds the recursion limit, this is likely due to a cyclic dependency.E.g. you might have a sequence of rules that can generate their own input. Try to make the output files more specific. A common pattern is to have different prefixes in the output files of different rules.
